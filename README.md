# Push_swap
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. 


# How to start and sort

git clone https://github.com/MirRinat/push_swap.git

cd push_swap

make

./push_swap --help

./push_swap (unsorted stack)    Sort stack

./checker (unsorted stack)      Check commands

-v              Print stacks after command

--clear         Clear window before sorting stacks

-c              View what command are doing(for checker)

For example:

./push_swap -v --clear 5 1 4 2 3  | ./checker
